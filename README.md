The script starts by importing Python’s re module (for regular expressions) which is used later to check if your password has any special characters.
Assessing Your Password: The main function here is assess_password_strength(password). It looks at your password and checks for a few things:
Does it have any numbers?
Does it include uppercase letters?
Does it include lowercase letters?
Is it at least 8 characters long?
Does it contain any special symbols like !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>?
It then counts how many of these boxes your password ticks. Based on that count, it gives a rating:
5/5: “Very Strong” (awesome, your password has all the bells and whistles).
4/5: “Strong”
3/5: “Moderate”
Less than 3: “Weak” (yikes, you might want to beef it up).
Giving You Some Tips: Before you even type your password, the script prints out a list of friendly tips to help you create a secure password. Things like using a mix of characters, avoiding personal details, and even considering a password manager are on that list.
User Input & Masking: Once you enter your password, the script doesn’t just show it back in full. Instead, it “masks” the middle characters with a bunch of # symbols—only keeping the first and last characters visible. This way, even if someone glances at your screen, they won’t see your full password.
Showing the Results: After checking the password, it prints out both your masked password and the strength rating based on the checks mentioned earlier.
Running the Script: The bottom part ensures that if you run the script directly (instead of importing it somewhere else), it executes the main function so everything kicks off nicely.

In short, this script is like a friendly little assistant that helps you understand whether your password is strong enough, gives you some security tips, and keeps your actual password a bit hidden when displaying it.
